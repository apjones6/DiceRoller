# Dice Roller for Windows Phone 8 #

This is a dice roller application for tabletop role playing games, such as _Dungeons and Dragons_, _Exalted_, and _Legend_. It is designs to handle common dice from D4 through to D%. Which dice are available should be made configurable in due course.

### Features ###
* Customize which dice are displayed and used (avoiding clutter)
* History
* Favorites
* Consistent UI with Windows Phone 8
* Rapid familiarization and use

## NuGet Packages ##

Currently this project uses NuGet packages which are not included in the GIT repository. These should be installed using the NuGet tools for now. I will work out how to get Visual Studio to install missing NuGet packages on build when I have time.
