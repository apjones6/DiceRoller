# Dice Roller for Windows Phone 8 #

This is a dice roller application for tabletop role playing games, such as _Dungeons and Dragons_, _Exalted_, and _Legend_. It is designed to handle common dice from D4 through to D%. Which dice are available should be made configurable in due course.

### Features ###
* Customize which dice are displayed and used (avoiding clutter)
* History
* Favourites
* Consistent UI with Windows Phone 8
* Rapid familiarization and use

## NuGet Packages ##

Currently this project uses NuGet packages which are not included in the GIT repository. Building the solution in Visual Studio should automatically install any missing packages. Note: At this moment I have an issue installing **WPtoolkit**, both automatically and using package manager directly; I surmise this may be an external issue, but going to note it here in the case issues persist.
